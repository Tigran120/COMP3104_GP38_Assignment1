Learning DevOps is essential in the modern software development cycle because it bridges the gap between development and operations teams. DevOps promotes automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery, ensuring faster and more reliable software releases. By understanding DevOps practices, developers can improve collaboration, reduce deployment errors, and respond quickly to user feedback. It also enhances scalability, security, and overall software quality. In short, DevOps transforms the traditional SDLC into a more efficient, agile, and adaptive process suited for todayâ€™s fast-paced tech environment.
