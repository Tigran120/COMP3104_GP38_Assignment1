101498001 – Why DevOps Matters in the SDLC

Overview:
DevOps integrates development and operations throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to shorten feedback loops, increase release frequency, and improve reliability.

Benefits Across SDLC Phases:
• Requirements & Design: Early collaboration exposes operational constraints (scalability, cost, compliance) before coding.  
• Implementation: Standardized tooling (Git, code reviews, linters) improves quality and developer velocity.  
• Testing: Automated pipelines run unit/integration tests and security scans on every change, catching defects earlier.  
• Deployment: CI/CD enables repeatable, low-risk releases through automation, canary/blue-green strategies, and rollbacks.  
• Operations: Monitoring, logging, and alerting deliver real-time feedback for continuous improvement (MTTR ↓, uptime ↑).  
• Security: “Shift-left” practices (SAST/SCA, secret management) reduce vulnerabilities before production.

Culture & Metrics:
• Shared ownership, blameless postmortems, and continuous learning  
• Measure DORA metrics: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, MTTR

Conclusion:
Learning DevOps equips me to build software that is testable, deployable, observable, and secure—essential for modern teams delivering value quickly and safely.
