Course Focus:
COMP 3104 introduces DevOps concepts and practices that connect software development with IT operations to deliver software faster and more reliably.

Key Topics:
• Git fundamentals, branching, and meaningful commit messages  
• CI/CD pipelines (build, test, package, deploy) with tools like GitHub Actions  
• Containerization with Docker; images, registries, Compose  
• Orchestration basics (Kubernetes concepts: pods, services, deployments)  
• Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform basics)  
• Cloud fundamentals (AWS/Azure services commonly used in pipelines)  
• Automated testing (unit/integration), code quality, and coverage  
• Observability: logging, metrics, alerts, dashboards  
• Security and DevSecOps: secrets, SCA, SAST, dependency scanning

Typical Assessments:
• Weekly labs to build CI/CD and container workflows  
• Team project: design a pipeline from commit to deploy  
• Short quizzes and a final practical demo

Learning Outcomes:
By the end, I can:
1) Use Git effectively with clear, incremental commits.  
2) Build a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests and deploys a containerized app.  
3) Apply basic IaC to provision environments.  
4) Integrate security and observability into delivery workflows.
